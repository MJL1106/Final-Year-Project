# Final Year Project

# To run
Run Driver.java, Might have to add:
"vmArgs": "--module-path \"project/src/main/resources/com/example/project/javafx-sdk-19/lib\" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
to the run configuration, I loaded the program on a separate machie and it was already there so should be fine.

# Info on interacting with GUI
In order: Select player amount, create players, start tournament, show points
