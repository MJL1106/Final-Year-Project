Project Diary
10/10/22: 
Begun the project. My aim for the next 2 weeks is to get the basic dilemma implemented and 
have a command line to enter choices.
- created an initial player object with tdd
11/10/22:
- added more setters getters to the player object
13/10/22:
Today I implemented the basic prisoner's dilemma by comparing users input.
There are some small problems that I will fix like being able to enter
defect/cooperate in the command line in any format
18/10/22:
I now have a basic terminal interface to prompt the players to enter their
name and choice of defect/cooperate which then gets stored in the 
player object
31/10/22:
Had family over the last week so had little time to work on the project
but I did manage to get a simple GUI working with javaFX and scenebuilder
01/11/22:
Up to this point I am a little behind on the milestones but 
over the next week I will make an initial GUI, create the iterated dilemma
and possibly add some strategies
09/11/22:
I have now make the dilemma iterated for 5 rounds and added some strategies that players
can select from a drop down menu. I will now work on getting the strategies to
work for head to head game and update the GUI to incorporate it all over the next
week
15/11/22:
Head to Head is now working and I also updated the gui so that players can be 
created using a drop down menu to select the amount of players the user wants
16/11/22:
I am now on schedule for the milestones and over the last 2 weeks I will make
updates to the GUI to implement the tournament feature and finish the javadoc 
23/11/22: 
The program is finished for this term and I will spend the remainding time writing my
report and checking over the program to find any hidden errors
26/11/22:
Fixed remaining small errors, code is finished. Overall I am happy with the progress I made
this term and I completed all the milestones that I set for myself. I would have liked to 
implement more strategies than just the select 4 that I chose but I decided that it would be more
beneficial to get the core concepts implemented as adding new strategies should be straight forward.
